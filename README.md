# Food_Calendar
My plan is to build an application which allows users to review the products their consume and check the kcal value of those products. The functionality is still improving. My idea is to make able for the users to save ingredients, kcal value and nourishment of each product they ate. I am thinking also about an option for enclosing a photo, so everyone could track a progress of weight loss.

My project is fully written in REACT js. For styling and animation, I used CSS. The navigation is made of React Router.  The database is created with JSON file and fetch for post method.
